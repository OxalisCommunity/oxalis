        Extensions having oxalis-extension as parent and using only dependencies available
        to oxalis-commons needs no extra dependencies.

        Extensions using functionality in other Oxalis modules may add them as dependencies
        marked as provided.

        Extensions using libraries not part of Oxalis will have to bundle those libraries
        when using the extension in Oxalis.
