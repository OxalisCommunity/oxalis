## Getting started

Before starting contributing, please make yourself aware of codebase, and also go through WIKI pages. 

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you found a bug/issue, before creating [issue](https://github.com/OxalisCommunity/oxalis/issues) first search if such issue already exist or not - Search in both open and [closed](https://github.com/OxalisCommunity/oxalis/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed) issues.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/OxalisCommunity/oxalis/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issue](https://github.com/OxalisCommunity/oxalis/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR - [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/OxalisCommunity/oxalis/blob/master/pull_request_template.md) 

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Oxalis Community team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [Oxalis Releases](https://github.com/OxalisCommunity/oxalis/releases).
